# Hi all! :hugs:

Welcome to my math repository

This serves me as:
1) a workbook for my math comprehensions exercises
2) a storage for some useful statistical and math probability functions. 

For example you can find here a class that plots:
	- Cumulative distribution function
	- Density distribution function 
from both raw and prepared data (can be found in *MatStat* folder)
