* Hi all! :hugs:

Welcome to my math repository

This serves me as:
1) a workbook for my math comprehensions exercises
2) a storage for some useful statistical and math probability functions. 
	- For example you can find here a class that plots from both raw and prepared data:
		- Cumulative distribution function
		- Density distribution function
